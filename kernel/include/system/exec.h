 /*
  * ELF file layout overview
  * ------------------------
  * An ELF binary begins with a fixed-size header (`elf64_ehdr`).  The first
  * sixteen bytes – stored in `e_ident` – encode several identification values
  * such as the ELF magic number, whether the file is 32/64 bit, and the data
  * endianness.  The remaining fields provide offsets that let us locate the
  * rest of the file:
  *
  *  - `e_entry` is the virtual address where execution begins once the file
  *    is loaded.
  *  - `e_phoff` points to the program header table, an array of `elf64_phdr`
  *    structures that describe segments to map into memory.
  *  - `e_shoff` points to the section header table.  The current loader does
  *    not use these entries, but the offsets still exist to maintain the
  *    standard ELF layout.
  *  - The various `*_size` and `*_num` fields describe how large the header
  *    tables are so the loader can iterate over them safely.
