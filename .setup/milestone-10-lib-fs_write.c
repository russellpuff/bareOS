 *            'fs_write' reads data from the 'buff' and copies it into the   *
 *            file  'blocks' starting  at the 'head'.  The  function  will   *
 *            allocate new blocks from the block device as needed to write   *
 *            data to the file and assign them to the file's inode.          *
